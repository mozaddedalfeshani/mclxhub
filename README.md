# MCLX: Simplified Windows Package Manager (Chocolatey-based)

This is an open-source project for creating a simplified package manager for Windows, named MCLX. It's designed to make installing software easier by providing a thin wrapper around Chocolatey.

**Important:** MCLX relies on Chocolatey. Users must have Chocolatey installed on their Windows system for MCLX to function.

## Core Concept

MCLX aims to provide a simplified interface for installing packages via Chocolatey. The initial implementation is focused on a website that contains the commands. Future development will bring the ability to use MCLX directly from the command line.
